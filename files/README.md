# 🚨 SafeZone AI by Bolunga

**An AI-powered public safety system that brings emergency response to your fingertips via WhatsApp and SMS—no app required.**

## 📌 Overview

SafeZone AI empowers communities by simplifying crime and emergency reporting. Citizens can report incidents via WhatsApp or SMS. An AI assistant (powered by LLaMA) classifies and routes these reports to nearby responders—police, private security, or NGOs—who can accept the call just like Uber. 

The system includes:
- Real-time responder tracking
- ETA countdown
- Supervisor dashboards
- Anonymous, multilingual input handling
- Predictive safety heatmaps
